<p>Use this rule to prevent values with octal numbers. In YAML, numbers that start with {@code 0} are interpreted as
    octal, but this is not always wanted. For instance <code>010</code> is the city code of Beijing, and should not be
    converted to <code>8</code>.</p>

<p>Examples</p>
<p>With <code>forbid-implicit-octal = true</code>
    the following code snippets would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    user:
      city-code: '010'
</pre>
<pre>
    user:
      city-code: 010,021
</pre>
<p>the following code snippet would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    user:
      city-code: 010
</pre>

<p>With <code>forbid-explicit-octal = true</code>
    the following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    user:
      city-code: '0o10'
</pre>
<p>the following code snippet would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    user:
      city-code: 0o10
</pre>
